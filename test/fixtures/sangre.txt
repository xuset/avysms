Avalanche dangers:
  Below treeline: moderate
  Treeline: considerable
  Above treeline: considerable

Dangerous avalanche conditions exist today particularly in near and above treeline areas. You can easily trigger avalanches in the new and freshly drifted snow. If you trigger an avalanche it can break into deeper weak layers resulting in a very large possibly deadly avalanche. You can trigger avalanche remotely, from the bottom of a slope, and from a distance. Avalanches can break in surprising ways. Wind have been changing direction during the storm period. You may find wind drifts in unusual places. If you trigger an avalanche in a wind drifted area it will be larger and more dangerous. Avoid travel on and under slopes steeper than about 30 degrees in near and above treeline areas where you find more than about 10 inches of new or wind-drifted snow.

There is a likely wind slab avalanche problem

There is a possible persistent slab avalanche problem

Special Avalanche Advisory expires on Tuesday, February 19, 2019 at 9:00 AM:
Avalanche conditions remain dangerous especially in portions of the Central and Southern Mountains. You can trigger avalanches that break in the new and wind drifted snow that will be large enough to bury or kill you. You may even be able to trigger very large very dangerous avalanches that break deepe...
