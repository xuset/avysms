You can easily trigger avalanches in the new and freshly drifted snow. If you trigger an avalanche it can break into deeper weak layers resulting in a very large possibly deadly avalanche. You can trigger avalanche remotely, from the bottom of a slope, and from a distance. Avalanches can break in surprising ways. Wind have been changing direction during the storm period. You may find wind drifts in unusual places. If you trigger an avalanche in a wind drifted area it will be larger and more dangerous. Avoid travel on and under slopes steeper than about 30 degrees in near and above treeline areas where you find more than about 10 inches of new or wind-drifted snow.", "problems": [{"py/object": "forecast.Problem", "likelyhood": "Likely", "problem_type": "WindSlab", "rose": {"AboveTreeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": false, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": false, "W": false}, "BelowTreeline": {"E": false, "N": false, "NE": false, "NW": false, "S": false, "SE": false, "SW": false, "W": false}, "Treeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": false, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": false, "W": false}}, "size": "SmallToLarge"}, {"py/object": "forecast.Problem", "likelyhood": "Possible", "problem_type": "PersistentSlab", "rose": {"AboveTreeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": true, "S": false, "SE": true, "SW": false, "W": false}, "BelowTreeline": {"E": false, "N": false, "NE": false, "NW": false, "S": false, "SE": false, "SW": false, "W": false}, "Treeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": true, "S": false, "SE": true, "SW": false, "W": false}}, "size": "Large"}], "warnings": [{"py/object": "forecast.Warning", "description": "Avalanche conditions remain dangerous especially in portions of the Central and Southern Mountains.
