You are most likely to trigger these avalanches from thin spots around rocks, or near the edges of slabs where the weak layers are closer to the surface making them easier to trigger.To stay safe in the mountains this weekend, avoidance is the key. It is getting harder for riders to trigger avalanches; however, if you do trigger an avalanche it will most likely be large and inescapable.To avoid avalanches, stick to lower angle slopes with no avalanche terrain above you. If you do chose to move into steeper terrain, you need to know that avalanches are not behaving in a very predictable way right now. You will not see signs of instability such as cracking or collapsing to help you make decisions. \nWhether you use the CAIC forecast every day or once a year, please consider becoming a Friend of CAIC by making a donation today. https://avalanche.state.co.us/donate/\"", "problems": [{"py/object": "forecast.Problem", "likelyhood": "Likely", "problem_type": "PersistentSlab", "rose": {"AboveTreeline": {"E": false, "N": false, "NE": false, "NW": false, "S": false, "SE": false, "SW": false, "W": false}, "BelowTreeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": true, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": true, "W": true}, "Treeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": true, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": true, "W": true}}, "size": "Large"}], "warnings": [], "zone": null}
