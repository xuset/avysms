It is getting harder for you to trigger an avalanche; however, if you do it will most likely be very large and inescapable. The only sure way to avoid large dangerous avalanches right now is to stick to lower angle slopes with no avalanche terrain above you. This means not traveling in avalanche runnouts or even timbered areas below avalanche starting zones. You can find safer riding options on wind-sheltered slopes less with a slope angle than 30 degrees without overhead hazard. If you do chose to move into steeper terrain, you need to understand that the weak layers are buried so deeply that you will not see signs of instability such as cracking or collapsing to help you make decisions. Digging down and looking or performing snowpack tests will give you little indication of the danger. There is no way to tell if a slope is safe right now it really comes down to your risk tolerance to where you choose to ride. Know that if you trigger an avalanche it will break deep, will break across terrain features, and will run to the valley floor.\nIt will be a warm day with temperatures reaching into the low 30's near and below treeline. Watch for small wet avalanches running from steep rocky southerly-facing terrain. Most of these avalanches will be small, but they may grow large enough to knock you off your feet and push you someplace you don't want to be.\nWhether you use the CAIC forecast every day or once a year, please consider becoming a Friend of CAIC by making a donation today. https://avalanche.state.co.us/donate/", "problems": [{"py/object": "forecast.Problem", "likelyhood": "Possible", "problem_type": "DeepPersistentSlab", "rose": {"AboveTreeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": true, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": true, "W": true}, "BelowTreeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": true, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": true, "W": true}, "Treeline": {"E": true, "N": true, "NE": true, "NW": true, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": true, "W": true}}, "size": "VeryLargeToHistoric"}, {"py/object": "forecast.Problem", "likelyhood": "Possible", "problem_type": "LooseWet", "rose": {"AboveTreeline": {"E": false, "N": false, "NE": false, "NW": false, "S": false, "SE": false, "SW": false, "W": false}, "BelowTreeline": {"E": false, "N": false, "NE": false, "NW": false, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": true, "W": false}, "Treeline": {"E": false, "N": false, "NE": false, "NW": false, "S": true, "SE": true, "SW": true, "W": false}}, "size": "Small"}], "warnings": [], "zone": null}
